# All About Templates

Templates are accessed through a [data store](extension-points.md#data-store) as a single JSON document, which must conform to a [JSON schema](../schema/templates-schema.yaml).


## Managing Templates

Some data stores have particular ways to manage the template document.  The [template manager](../src/py-tool-template-manager) tool helps to manage the document, and individual templates within that document.
