# About

Tests for the shell scripts that run the system.

Because the system is driven by shell scripts, the project must ensure that they continue to work after changes are made.

These tests are intended to be run from a docker sandbox, generated from the [Dockerfile.shell-test](../Dockerfile.shell-test) file.  If you try to run them locally, it can potentially seriously change your computer files.
