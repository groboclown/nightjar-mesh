Protection levels for service routes.

Routes are allowed to have any name for protection, but it must conform to the
`is_valid_route_protection` call.

Currently, the system only supports two modes of protection: public and private.
Public means that the published route will be available to all entry-points into
the mesh.  Private means that only services within the mesh can reach it.

Consideration has been made to allow other levels to represent intra-mesh
communication protection levels.  In this construct, the protection level acts
as a key, where the proxy needs to provide that protection level and the route
has that protection level.
